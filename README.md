## AI SNN
### or Artificial Intelligence Stuttering Neural Network

Is a Project I have been wanting to do in my entire life;
it will (or, more specifically `it's goal is to`) help those who stutters, like myself.

### How?
- Good question. My first question was exactly that. "How?!"

- Will continue adding soon.
- as a further reading:
- `note: not mine` [stuttered-speech-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks at ijert.org](https://www.ijert.org/research/stuttered-speech-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks-IJERTCONV9IS12057.pdf)



## Why make this repo?
- Q) Excluding it will help stuttering?

- A) This whole "thing" called Stuttering; needs to be more researched in my opinion.
