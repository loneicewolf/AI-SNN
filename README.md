### or Artificial Intelligence Stuttering Neural Network

Is a Project I have been wanting to do in my entire life;

### How?
- Good question. My first question was exactly that. "How?!"

- Will continue adding soon.
- as a further reading:

## Why make this repo?
- Q) Excluding it will help stuttering?

- A) This whole "thing" called Stuttering; needs to be more researched in my opinion.
